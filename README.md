A local Gemfile where you can add gems that you don't want to add to the repository

# Install

Copy Gemfile.local into project root and add the following to your .gitignore:

	/Gemfile.local
	/Gemfile.local.lock

To use Gemfile.local run:

	bundle --gemfile Gemfile.local

Bundler is excellent for managing dependencies of my applications but not for managing my custom dependencies. There are gems that Iâ€™d like to use locally, knowing their implications, without forcing that behavior on other developers or designers on the team. One such gem is rails-dev-boost, which speeds up my development environment considerably. Gemfile.local solves this limitation.

Create Gemfile.local at Rails.root with the following content:
    eval File.read('Gemfile')
    group :development do
      gem 'rails-dev-boost', :git => 'git://github.com/thedarkone/rails-dev-boost.git', :require => 'rails_development_boost'
    end

Then execute these commands from Rails.root:
    cp Gemfile.lock Gemfile.local.lock
    BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.local bundle
    echo "$(cat .gitignore)\nGemfile.local\nGemfile.local.lock" > .gitignore
    git commit -m "Added Gemfile.local to .gitignore." .gitignore

Whenever you need to use your custom Gemfile.local you can prepend the command with:
    BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.local bundle exec

For example, start the rails server by executing:
    BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.local bundle exec rails s

Enjoy the benefits of your custom Gemfile.

Note: This should store a config in the .bundle/config file and then read from that, however I couldn't get this to work for the BUNDLE_GEMFILE config no matter what I tried. There is a bug request to add this as standard functionality to Bundler, however it appears there is nobody around to work on it:
